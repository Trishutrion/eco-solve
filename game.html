            <h2>Eco-Quest: Part 1</h2>
            An environmental disaster has occured! <br>
            Water-soluble aliens have made their way from outer space into clouds in Earth's atmosphere, <br>
            so they fall to the Earth alongside rain from these clouds. <br>
            They then permeate into the soil and cause intense erosion, damaging crop yields and floral biodiversity. <br>
            In short, Earth is under attack! <br>
            <br>
            However, your team of scientists has discovered a solution.
            If you trap the aliens in nitric acid, they will be paralysed, hence reducing the threat they pose to the environment. <br>
            So, on a rainy day, your team creates a giant vat of nitric acid and sets off, hoping to catch some aliens in the process. <br>
