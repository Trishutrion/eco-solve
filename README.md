The quizzes are 5-10 questions long and cover the topics in the videos. 
These quizzes are adaptive, so depending on how many questions you get right, the difficulty level will change as well. 

Hailstone Dodger
For some downtime and a bit of fun, Eco-Solve offers a unique mini-game called Hailstone Dodger. 
In the game, you are a blue rectangle trying to dodge hailstone, which are grey circles, and survive for as long as possible. 
You can use the arrow keys or the 'a' and 'd' keys to move, but you are unable to leave the game screen. 
How long can you survive??? 

Personal Tracker
Using the personal tracke feature of Eco-Solve, you can set your own sustainability goals and reduce your own negative impact on the environment. 
Importantly, the data is stored in a .txt file, so it is not on any cloud or system. 
We value privacy at Eco-Solve, so your data is yours and not being fed into a database of some sorts. 
So don't worry, just give it a go.
