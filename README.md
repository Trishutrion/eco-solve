The quizzes are 5-10 questions long and cover the topics regarding sustainability. <br>
These quizzes are adaptive, so depending on how many questions you get right, the difficulty level will change as well. <br>

Hailstone Dodger <br>
For some downtime and a bit of fun, Eco-Solve offers a unique mini-game called Hailstone Dodger. <br>
In the game, you are a blue rectangle trying to dodge hailstones, which are grey circles, and survive for as long as possible. <br>
You can use the arrow keys or the 'a' and 'd' keys to move, but you are unable to leave the game screen. <br>
How long can you survive??? <br>

Personal Tracker <br>
Using the personal tracker feature of Eco-Solve, you can set your own sustainability goals and reduce your negative impact on the environment. <br>
We value privacy at Eco-Solve, so your data is stored in a .json file, so it is not on any cloud or system. <br>
