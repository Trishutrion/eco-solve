      Calling all environmentalists! <br>
      Eco-Solve is an environmental education website where users can learn more about the environment, current environmental issues, 
      and make more sustainable choices. <br>
      To do this, users can watch videos, take quizzes, play games, and even set their own sustainability goals. 

      <a href="video.html"><h3>Videos</h3></a> 
      The <a href="video.html">videos</a> page of Eco-Solve is for all visual learners wanting to learn more about the environment. <br>
      Currently, the only video available is the award-winning short film "Echoes of Humanity", <br>
      a dystopian tale about the last human alive leaving a message about how humanity destroyed the environment.      

      <a href="quiz.html"><h3>Quizzes</h3></a> 
      Want to test yourself? <br>
      Eco-Solve's <a href="quiz.html">quiz</a> webpage is sure to provide both a challenge and a benchmark for how well you are progressing. <br>
      The quizzes are 5-10 questions long and cover topics about environmental science. <br>
      The questions are in a random order, so be prepared for whatever comes your way. 

      <a href="game.html"><h3>Mini-Game</h3></a> 
      For some downtime and fun, Eco-Solve offers a <a href="game.html">mini-game</a> called Eco-Quest. <br>
      In the game, there is a tank which collects greenhouse gas particles, and the more particles that are collected, the more the temperature drops, 
      hence the particles will fall faster as well. <br>
      The time left, the temperature, and the number of particles collected will be displayed on the screen. 
      The arrow keys or the 'a' and 'd' keys can be used to move the tank, but the tank cannot leave the game screen. <br>
      The aim of the game is to collect as many greenhouse gas particles as possible within one minute. 
      How many particles can you collect? Let's find out! 

      <a href="personalTracker.html"><h3>Personal Tracker</h3></a> 
      Using the <a href="personalTracker.html">personal personalTracker</a> feature of Eco-Solve, it is now possible to check your current environmental footprint 
      by entering data into our personal personalTracker. <br>
      In addition, you can set your own sustainability goals and reduce your negative impact on the environment. <br>
      We value privacy at Eco-Solve, so your data is stored in a .txt file and is not accessible to anyone else (even us, for that matter).
