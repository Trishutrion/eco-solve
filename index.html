      <a href="game.html"><h3>Hailstone Dodger</h3></a>
      For some downtime and a bit of fun, Eco-Solve offers a unique <a href="game.html">mini-game</a> called Hailstone Dodger. <br>
      In the game, you are a blue rectangle trying to dodge hailstone, which are grey circles, and survive for as long as possible. <br>
      You can use the arrow keys or the 'a' and 'd' keys to move, but you are unable to leave the game screen. <br>
      How long can you survive??? <br>

      <a href="tracker.html"><h3>Personal Tracker</h3></a>
      Using the <a href="tracker.html">personal tracker</a> feature of Eco-Solve, you can set your own sustainability goals and reduce your own negative impact on the environment. <br>
      Importantly, the data is stored in a .txt file, so it is not on any cloud or system. <br>
      We value privacy at Eco-Solve, so your data is yours and not being fed into a database of some sorts. <br>
      So don't worry, just give it a go.
